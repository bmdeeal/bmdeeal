Hi there! I'm Brenden Deeal. I write a fair bit of software, and I've been getting it all suitible for public consumption here on GitHub.

My current major project is [quig](https://github.com/bmdeeal/quig), an easy-to-use C++ and SDL-based system for writing simple games with scaling graphics in Lua. Alongside it is [quig-ui](https://github.com/bmdeeal/quig-ui), a convenient frontend written in C# that makes it easy to create, edit, and run games for quig.
